Mother-Father-Child Trio aligner
===============================

Computes the m-f-c similarity among a mother-father-childe trio. 
and the phasing of the child that leads to the best alignment.

The input consist in the haplotype of the parents and of the child, expressed as a 
pair-wise sequence alignment. 
Wether the input alignments are correctly phased or not is indistinct for the algorithm.
